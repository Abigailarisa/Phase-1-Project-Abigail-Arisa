# CAUGHT EM'

Today we'll be building an application to view pokemon in a pokedex.

## Demo

Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

> To view in VSCode, right click on the README.md file and select "Open Preview".

## Setup

Run this command to get the backend started:

```sh
json-server --watch db.json
```

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

[https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)

Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Write your code in the `src/index.js` file. The base URL for your API will be
[https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/).

## Deliverables

As a user, I can:

1. Populate the content-box using the flavor_text array

2. Toggle a light/dark mode

3. Display a love button to the screen
